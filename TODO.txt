# Refactoring
[+] Add comprehensive type hints and make mypy pass in strict mode (`mypy dndgame --strict`)
    [ ] Add proper types for all class attributes
    [ ] Add return types and parameter types for all methods
    [ ] Fix any type-related issues mypy finds

[+] Add complete docstrings
    [ ] Class docstrings explaining purpose and attributes
    [ ] Method docstrings with parameters and return types
    [ ] Add examples in docstrings where helpful

[ ] Code is not optimized for adding a new character race. Fix this, and add a new character.

[ ] Input validation for user input

[ ] Improve OOP Structure:
    [ ] Create an Enemy class
    [ ] Refactor Character and Enemy classes to use a common Entity base class
    [ ] Update the Combat class to use the new classes
    [ ] Replace simple_combat function with Combat class usage.
    [ ] Ensure that the Goblin also attacks the player. What happens if the player has 0 HP?

[ ] Convert loops to functional programming
    [ ] Use list comprehensions where appropriate
    [ ] Use map()/filter() where appropriate

# Testing
[ ] Add comprehensive unit tests (have a look at the test_dice.py file for inspiration)
    [ ] Test the character class
    [ ] Test the combat system
    [ ] Achieve at least 90% test coverage

# Optional Stretch Goals
[ ] Add different weapon types with different damage dice
[ ] Add simple spellcasting system
[ ] Add an experience points and leveling system
[ ] (Advanced) Create a DungeonMaster class which uses OpenAI's API to narrate the game (start simple with just narrating the comabt, extend it to narrate the choices and actions of the players)
